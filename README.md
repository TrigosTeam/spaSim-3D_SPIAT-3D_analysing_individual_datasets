This repo contains R scripts for:  
- Simulation and analysis of simulated dataset 1 (SD1), found in the /analysing_individual_simulated_datasets/SD1_change_all_parameters directory.
- Simulation and analysis of simulated dataset 2 (SD2), found in the /analysing_individual_simulated_datasets/SD2_change_each_parameter directory.
- Analysis of public datasets, found in the /analysing_individual_public_datasets directory.

The output of the results are found in the paper: '2D spatial tissue analysis often misrepresents true biological patterns of 3D tissues'
